            <h1>London</h1>
            <p>
              London is the capital city of England and the United Kingdom. It
              is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a
              metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants. Standing on the
              River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two
              millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans,
              who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London,
              largely retains its 2.9 km2 mediaeval boundaries and in 2011 had a
              resident population of 7,375; making it the smallest city in
              England. Since at least the 19th century, the term London has also
              referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of
              this conurbation forms the Greater London administrative area
              (coterminous with the London region), governed by the Mayor of
              London and the London Assembly.
            </p>
            <p>
              London is a leading global city, with strengths in the arts,
              commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare,
              media, professional services, research and development, tourism,
              and transport. It is one of the world's leading financial centres
              and has the fifth-or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the
              world depending on measurement. London is a world cultural
              capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by
              international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport
              system measured by passenger traffic. London's 43 universities
              form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in
              Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to host the modern
              Summer Olympic Games three times.
            </p>
            <p>
              London has a diverse range of peoples and cultures, and more than
              300 languages are spoken within Greater London. The region had an
              official population of 8,416,535 in 2013, the largest of any
              municipality in the European Union, and accounting for 12.5% of
              the UK population. London's urban area is the second most populous
              in the EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants according to
              the 2011 census. The city's metropolitan area is the third most
              populous in Europe after Moscow and Istanbul, with 13,614,409
              inhabitants, while the Greater London Authority puts the
              population of London metropolitan region at 21 million. London was
              the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.

            <h1>Tokyo</h1>
            <p>
              Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and
              one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most
              populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the
              Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the
              Kanto region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu
              and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known
              as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603
              when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It
              officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat
              to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time
              Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from
              the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture and the city of Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tokyo is often referred to as a city, but is officially known and
              governed as a "metropolitan prefecture", which differs from and
              combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic
              unique to Tokyo. The Tokyo metropolitan government administers the
              23 Special Wards of Tokyo (each governed as an individual city),
              which cover the area that was the City of Tokyo before it merged
              and became the metropolitan prefecture in 1943. The metropolitan
              government also administers 39 municipalities in the western part
              of the prefecture and the two outlying island chains. The
              population of the special wards is over 9 million people, with the
              total population of the prefecture exceeding 13 million. The
              prefecture is part of the world's most populous metropolitan area
              with upwards of 37.8 million people and the world's largest urban
              agglomeration economy. The city hosts 51 of the Fortune Global 500
              companies, the highest number of any city in the world. Tokyo
              ranked third in the International Financial Centres Development
              IndexEdit. The city is also home to various television networks
              such as Fuji TV, Tokyo MX, TV Tokyo, TV Asahi, Nippon Television,
              NHK and the Tokyo Broadcasting System.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tokyo ranked first in the Global Economic Power Index and fourth
              in the Global Cities Index. The city is considered an alpha+ world
              city – as listed by the GaWC's 2008 inventory and in 2014, Tokyo
              was ranked first in the "Best overall experience" category of
              TripAdvisor's World City Survey (the city also ranked first in the
              following categories: "helpfulness of locals", "nightlife",
              "shopping", "local public transportation" and "cleanliness of
              streets"). In 2015, Tokyo was ranked as the 11th most expensive
              city for expatriates, according to the Mercer consulting firm, and
              also the world's 11th most expensive city, according to the
              Economist Intelligence Unit's cost-of-living survey. In 2015,
              Tokyo was named the Most Liveable City in the world by the
              magazine Monocle. The Michelin Guide has awarded Tokyo by far the
              most Michelin stars of any city in the world. Tokyo ranked first
              in the world in the Safe Cities Index. The 2016 edition of QS Best
              Student Cities ranked Tokyo as the 3rd-best city in the world to
              be a university student. Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics,
              the 1979 G-7 summit, the 1986 G-7 summit, and the 1993 G-7 summit,
              and will host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the 2020 Summer
              Paralympics.
